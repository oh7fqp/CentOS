# To connect to CentOS using Putty without password
# Create Key-Pair
# This will create 2 files:
# - id_rsa      # This is private key to be used on a Client machine
# - id_rsa.pub  # This is public key, to be installed on a CentOS server
ssh-keygen -t rsa

# You need to setup authoriced key files. Copy single line from id_rsa.pub to new file called authorized_keys
nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
# Set up permissions
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chown $USER:$USER ~/.ssh -R
# Setup sshd to use file created
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# add line: AuthorizedKeysFile %h/.ssh/authorized_keys
sudo service ssh restart

# Putty can not use this private key in its current format, you need to convert it using PuttyGen
# Copy file id_rsa to your Client computer
# Open PuttyGen
# Click Conversions, import key, and select file id_rsa
# Export using Save private key -button
# In Pytty configuration, select exported ppk-file in category Connection/SSH/Auth
# Enjoy passwordless connection
